# VBA of Wallstreet

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to automate the data analysis of stocks for Steve. Often used in the finance industry, VBA helps automate the analysis process instead of manually analyzing the stock data and using Excel formulas for calucations. The VBA process use code to automate tasks, crease chances of errors, and reduce the time to run analyses. In this project, refactored code is utilized to make the stock analysis quicker. When refactoring code, the code is more efficient, taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

## Results

### 2017 Stock Analysis

When using the original code "AllStockAnalysis", the code took 0.7734375 seconds to run. The refactored code only took 0.1132813 seconds

By using the refactored code, the analysis time was saved by 7 fold. This mean that the refactored code is 7 times faster than the orginal code "AllStockAnalysis"

## Summary

### Advantage of Refactoring Code
The two advantages of refactoring code:
From this project, the analysis time is quicker and more efficient, especially if the code needs through run through a big data set
The code is easier to read, taking fewer steps, and involve less memory

### Disadvantage of Refactoring Code
The two disadvantages of refactoring code:
Time is needed to refactor the code; one must be able to ensure that there is no impact to the result of the previous code
Restructuring the variables can lead to mistakes, which leads to down time to resolve the issues.

### Pros and Cons of refactoring the original VBA script:

Pros: The refactoring code can be used to scale for bigger data set with a more reduced and quicker analysis time.
VBA script is more efficient, require fewer step, and easier for future users to understand.

Cons: The refactoring code took time to update and took many revisions to ensure that it matches the results of the original code.
